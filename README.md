## Purpose 

This project builds all cloud infrastructure in AWS using CDK (Cloud Development Kit). It includes all the necessary roles, permissions, ECR repository, VPC, ECS services, RDS etc. for all the major components of ReCiter, ReCiter Publication Manager, ReCiterDB, ReCiter PubMed Retrieval Tool, and optionally ReCiter Scopus Retrieval Tool.

[ReCiter](https://github.com/wcmc-its/reciter/) is a highly accurate system for guessing which publications in PubMed a given person has authored. ReCiter includes a Java application, a DynamoDB-hosted database, and a set of RESTful microservices which collectively allow institutions to maintain accurate and up-to-date author publication lists for thousands of people. This software is optimized for disambiguating authorship in PubMed and, optionally, Scopus. 

ReCiter can be installed on a locally controlled server or using services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). For those looking to install ReCiter on AWS, this cloud repository provides a easy way to install in the cloud.

The `cdk.json` file provides instructions for AWS's CDK Toolkit for installing your app and all the necessary dependencies.

This project is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)-based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

Enjoy!


## Dependencies

The following are the technical dependencies. With the exception of Homebrew and Python, installation instructions are provided below.

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - tool for installing libraries on your Mac
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - preferably Python 3.4 or greater
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) - package installer for Python
- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) - Amazon Web Services Cloud Development Kit
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - Amazon Web Services command-line interface
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript library used by Publication Manager

This CDK can work on non-Mac systems, but these instructions were written with Mac users in mind.




## Installation instructions

**1. Install the AWS CLI (command-line interface) on your local machine.** 
 - Verify that you have Python installed, preferably Python 3.4 or greater. 
    - To check on your version of Python, enter the following in Terminal: `python --version`
    - If Python is not the proper version, enter: `brew install python`

**12. Perform the installation**
  - Go to your terminal where you have cloned this repository. If not cloned then use `git clone https://github.com/wcmc-its/ReCiter-CDK.git`
  - Run `cdk synth --profile <profile-name>` and this will synthesize all the cloudformation template for you in `cdk.out` folder. If also if you have not environment variables properly it will prompt you.
  - Run `cdk bootstrap --profile <profile-name>` to create a s3 bucket to house the templates where `<profile-name>` is the profile name you gave when you set up the aws-cli with `aws configure --profile reciter`
  - Run `cdk deploy --profile reciter` reciter is the profile name you gave when you set up the aws-cli with `aws configure --profile reciter`
  - This should take some time and you can login to AWS and go to Cloudformation service to see the progress. After it is installed you can go search for ECS and click on Stack and go to Output section to see the url for ReCiter and its components.

 - Remember all the resources here will be publicly accessible over the internet. Although we have a web application firewall providing necessary security against malicious bots and others, it is advisable to use it using SSL and valid certificate.
 - You will receive the email you entered for `ALARM_EMAIL`. Click on that to confirm the subscription. You will also receive emails when pipeline runs to get approval. You have to approve all the pipeline by clicking the links you get in the email.
 - The ReCiter-Publication-Manager will not work untill and unless you manually approve the pipeline. To do so, go to AWS console and then to CodePipeline then click on `ReCiter-Publication-Manager`. The Pipeline should be at the Approve stage. Click on Review and then Accept. You will also receive an email with the email you have entered for `ALARM_EMAIL`.




## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation


## Troubleshooting


Q: I'm currently having trouble logging into the ReCiter publication manager. I created users through the API and can use the API to verify that they can authenticate, but when I try to use the same username/password at the login form, I always get "bad credentials".

A: See the final step. You must re-run the pipeline for ReCiter-Publication-Manager in CodePipeline service in AWS. Since it uses the same load balancer URL to reference both ReCiter and ReCiter-Pubmed-Retrieval-Tool and we get the load balancer URL after the stack is deployed.
